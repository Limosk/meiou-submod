[*]Removed one decision (the Millet System) which was causing the game to freeze.
[*]Restored the piety and church influence systems for all countries, which will restore the functionality of several events and decisions.
[*]Removed several Paradox decisions and events which add reform_desire to the game. This will have the effect of having the Reformation start later, although it is still likely to fire decades before it historically did (the lowering events aren't scripted yet, and I'm still tracking down one or two Paradox events giving more reform desire). Now, however, we're talking 1460, not 1370.
[*]Added a triggered modifier so the player has an idea what their piety level is without checking their tolerance.
[*]Changed the triggers of a few triggered modifiers so they properly check the right provinces. Temporarily removed a few that were looking at the wrong province due to lack of time to fix them properly.

Some of the effects were not included, unfortunately, due to a recurring bug with the DG_Catholic event file which forced me to not include the changes until the bug is found and fixed.

[*]Two Paradox localisation files are now included, with sections missing, so that Dei Gratia changes to Patriarch Authority and Piety show up properly.
[*]Archbishoprics now properly show up, and countries that own them gain a bonus to papal influence at the beginning of the game as well as a small bonus throughout the game.  They are in historical locations, meaning that Italy is a tempting prize for someone wishing to become Papal Controller.
[*]The 'Witch Hunt' event now has proper localisation for all three of its options.
[*]Two events now reduce reform desire slightly; jubilee years and starting a church council (church councils always fail, however - the event chains are not finished).

[*]Add food profitability related informations in province interaction tab.
[*]Change farm efficiency calculation. Farm efficiency = 120 / (1 + e^(-0.05*farm_efficiency_ducat_ticker*FE_rank/(12*rural_population))) - 60, where farm_efficiency_ducat_ticker is the amount of ducats invested into farm efficiency and FE_rank the province's aptitude for food production.
[*]Changed how Great Predators make peace. Certain conditions must be met before they're willing to come out to a peace table, but they're no longer such a pain in the ass when they're losing.
[*]Implement the concept of 'chunk' in Great Predator AI. Every prey will be consisted of 1 or more chunks, where chunks are aggregation of same owner provinces that are interconnected on land. Among those chunks, the prey will select the chunk with a highest value and set its value to be equal to that chunk. No matter how many chunks one country has, only the one with the best value will be used in AI calculation. This addition is to solve the issue with far away countries taking a small chunk of land in gps vicinity which then halts gps expansion into that area because the mainland of the country holding is so far away.

[*]Reworked farm estates and plantations into a single building set, Rural Infrastructure. No longer acts as a gate to food export, instead effecting food profitability.

##Estates
[*]New system for estate loyalty change. Whenever there's a change in some estate's income or influence, that estate's loyalty will change accordingly.
[*]Estate taxation system. Estates will pay tax in wealth and manpower according to their loyalty and influence.
[*]Reworked estate privileges. Now, it is directly integrated to estate's income and influence.

##Tribes
[*]Tribal estate (beta) implemented, with a unique set of mechanics and special interaction with POP mechanics.
[*]Tribal Levies aren't based on annual income, instead they are based on their total treasury. Rich tribal estates will use their wealth to fund a larger tribal host.
[*]When tribal levies are called, they expect their expense of calling the host back as loot. Loyalty gains are based off whether their loot share matches this amount.
[*]Settled nations call levies based on their loyalty, with a directly proportionate amount given in response.
[*]Tribal settlement is tracked through three variables, Tribal Population, Settlement Gravity and Settlement Progress.
[*]Settlement Gravity is calculated every year through an extensive calc, using a wide range of environmental and provincial factors.
[*]Tribal Population is measured via a 1-100 percentage, changed either yearly by Settlement Gravity, or directly through province damage.
[*]Provinces with tribals increase their historical settlement progress by diverting wealth from farming efficiency to settlement score. Both rural and urban wealth are included.
[*]Tribes will become minorities when Burghers seize the province, or when the tribal population drops below 20%, remaining as a lower autonomy modifier and continuing to increase settlement score through FE ducats.
[*]Tribes in Epirus and Anatolia will flip back and forth to Greek/Turkish culture based on whether tribals control the province.
[*]Tribes have unique interactions, built around appeasement. The stats of a ruler are pivotal to better outcomes from tribal interactions.
[*]Nomadic tribes have unique mechanics, including horde unity thats dependent on a rulers stats, a higher levy cavalry ratio, a speed boost in their own territory and a separate set of CBs they are restricted to (conquest, tribute and submission (of other hordes)).
[*]New Tribal Governments, including Tribal Elective Monarchy, Tribal Confederation, Tribal Theocracy and Tribal Nomads (elective and hereditary).
[*]Tribal Nomads have access to the Nomad CBs with more restrictive conditions, as well as Tribal Tribute.
[*]Legalism's distribution is now based on tribal population initially. Nations with tribes will not gain Legalism until after POP initialisation.
[*]Implemented backbone of super secret system for tribes. Sits in the background at the moment, unused in the code.

##HRE
[*]HRE Defense System: Princes and Emperor corporate on the defense against empire. The amount of contribution is dependent on diplomatic factors and the comparison of strengths between attacker and defender (stronger enemy more contribution, weaker ones, less contribution).
[*]Ostsiedlung culture conversion system: The Ostsiedlung decision now speeds up the progress of culture conversion in the Ostsiedlung area. All provinces that were historically part of the Ostsiedlung will convert to German cultures over time (as long as they are in the HRE). Added starting conversion progress data depending on historical situation.
[*]Rebelanced bonuses from being the Holy Roman Emperor.
[*]Voting pattern of electors for becoming Holy Roman Emperor have been changed in favor of larger and German nations.
[*]Prevent AI Italian states, which are not part of the HRE from just joining it because of raised relations (Venice, Genoa, Pope).

[*]Being a member of the HRE now gives a -0.1 malice to yearly absolutism.
[*]The emperor now has the same malice to claim fabrication cost as the other members of the HRE.

[*]Major trade rework, removing shortcuts and adding custom pathing.

# POP

[*]The Rural, Urban and Upper Population numbers have been replaced with a dynamic development system, calculated after the startup events.
[*]Dynamic development uses literal wealth output to calculate the development values, mapped to the source categories of Rural, Urban and Upper.
[*]Population is now displayed via a modifier for the province, and in the State Estate within the 'Stability and National Quality' interaction.
[*]Replaced all stats from the old population numbers with a 'real values' system, using binary modifiers to apply the effects of any 3 decimal POP value.
[*]Population values are now stored in 1:1000 scale, instead of 1:10000 scale. All core POP statistics have accordingly been rescaled.
[*]Urban Gravity as well is now 1:1000 scale, and all building localisation has been updated to reflect this. Actual effects are the same.
[*]Art power's POP scaling has been reworked to actually be dependent on the literal urban upper class population, instead of the weighting for upper urban. Should result in less overkill art power from great cities.

[*]Province AI should always obey the vast majority of building restrictions, ensuring construction doesnt occur unless all reqs are met.

# Colonisation

[*]Removed all old colonial scripts from the game, as a starting point.

[*]Uncolonised provinces are no longer ignored by major POP systems such as food, ensuring general stability in colonial regions.
[*]Native American removal/Central African removal no longer wipe out all province data, preventing major issues in the late game.
[*]The Americas and Sub-saharan Africa now use density mapping and scripts to calculate the population of both continents. This new data replaces startup POP counts, and allows more realistic Innate Fertility values.
[*]Fur, ivory, fish and pearls have been revived from the province history graveyard, and brought to 1356. North America and Siberia in particular have seen major improvements in trade value as a result.
[*]Added a set of modifiers for the Atlantic Cod, improving trade value in Northeast America and far-north Europe.
[*]Mines are also brought back from the dead, and are able to be discovered by nations using the deposit system. Also added historical silver mines to Mexico using this system.
[*]Colonial Nations can now recieve subsidies from their overlord, inversely funded based on their need. AI should always take this option, and fund their colonies accordingly.
[*]AI can now move their capital without needing infrastructure, allowing colonial nations to properly fix their CE.
[*]Provinces in North/South America will now recieve less unrest when owned by a nation in a different continent. Should ensure new colonies don't revolt immediately before a colonial nation appears.
[*]Tribal provinces in the America's owned by colonisers should now change culture to their overlord when they become lesser nobles (below 20%).

# Setup

[*]If a tag has one of Min, Yue cultures or Jianghuai, then province names will reflect the dialect. (Province renaming can be turned off in game options for those who prefer Putonghua only).
[*]All cultures in Yunnan and Guangxi except for Hani received a revolter tag. Kirgiz received alt-history Qara Qirgiz tag.
[*]A new Chinese dynasty Nan (?) added. Will be preferably chosen by Dai Viet or Rau cultures.

[*]Zhuang get a decision to reform Sawndip, giving small bonus to tech cost in vein of other similar decisions.
[*]Removed Woji tag. Turns out it is likely that they and Udege were the same.
[*]Mandate of Heaven owners will now see Mandate mechanic in game. Mandate rises with stability and conquering provinces in China. It drops through province devastation. Empires which mandate drops below 50 will now start to experience the same debuffs as with Mongol Xingsheng modifier. The modifier remains for vassals and for players without the DLC.

# Plague

[*]The plague system has been completely reworked, using a new province-to-province spread model based on province_event's instead of monthly timers.
[*]A new 'province immunity' variable has been added, measuring how resistant a population is to plague. Immunity works on a -100 to 100 scale, and is added through plague death at 50%. 25% dead would mean 12.5% more immunity.
[*]Native Plagues have been removed from the game, and replaced with some custom triggers and -100 immunity for the new world.
[*]Australia and Oceania will now also have negative immunity
[*]Trade center spread is now based on Trade Nodes, and the actual flow of trade from nation to nation.

[*]Added more rules and limitations to Christian culture flipping in Egypt, the Levant and Iraq, creating a more plausible spread.
[*]In case of Chinese ruler being taken prisoner there is a chance of an event firing which puts another prince on the throne. Once the former Emperor returns he might stage a coup to restore his rule. (based on Tumu Crisis)
[*]If Song is defeated, Han Lin'er will move to a different tag allied with Song.
[*]Unique decisions for Sakha (yes, they have a little bit of flavour) once again available to take.

#Japan

[*]Japan gameplay improved with the additions of new events and decision, along with updated historical setup.
[*]Imperial Japan can adopt Chinese government if Confucian and embraced Meritocracy.
[*]During Nanboku-cho period the tags on each side can every 5 years (provided there is no truce with overlord) switch sides to the opposing court.
[*]Great and Lesser nobles instead demanding for privilege, can instead ask for a vassal to be released.
[*]Ryukyu starts confined to Okinawa with a nasty autonomy increasing province modifier representing split into 3 kingdoms. The modifier can be removed by increasing centralisation.
[*]Ryukyu can expand into other islands by decision to send military or diplomatic missions. Alternatively they can get Exploration/Expansion ideas. The decision is also available to an independent ruler of Satuma.
[*]A Japanese state with high centralisation can enact a decision which allows for turning daimyo subjects into Domains, which cannot start wars with their neighbours.
[*]Japanese tags cannot ally with non-Japanese powers during the periods of civil wars.
[*]Added a peace option to turn enemy into a Daimyo instead of normal vassal. Can be targeted only against tags with Japanese Monarchy.
[*]Subjects of Japan or Shogun can ask to be granted a title of Kanrei. While there can be multiple tags with the appointment, only one tag will be given Kanrei title. After the death of the holder it will pass to the next eligible tag.
[*]Subjects of Japan or Shogun can ask to be granted a title of Tandai. There are Kyushu, Chugoku, Shikoku, Ou (merged O and U Tandai titles) Tandai to choose, depending on the capital location.
[*]Shogun can try to usurp Emperorship by first making himself a retired Emperor. Vassals might rebels if this occurs. If successful then on the Shogun's death the successor will proclaim himself the new Emperor.
[*]An independent Daimyo who controls Imperial Capital (Kyoto at the game start), can ask the Emperor to move capital to Daimyo's. (Ouchi tried this in RL)
[*]Daimyo have very high base LD. Granting them Tandai or Kanrei title decreases it considerably.
[*]Added Asakura and Koto tags.
[*]If a dynasty change occurs, then the dynasty is changed to conform to the tag.
[*]Any tag of Japanese culture which owns 60 provices in Japan can form Japan on embracement of Enlightenment.
[*]If a regency occurs in uncentralised Shogunate Kanrei has an option to replace Shogun with his own candidate, which vassalizes the Shogun to Kanrei along with all Daimyo. Other Daimyo can contest this choice through war. If they win war, then Shogun is restored and vassalized by the winning Daimyo. (Onin war)
[*]If the battle of Shoguns remains indecisive for 5 years then Sengoku Jidai begins. All tags vassal to Shogun can then declare independence without war. The period ends when a new Shogunate is proclaimed.
[*]Sengoku Jidai period can also be triggered by warfare over Kanrei position.
[*]Fellow Daimyo vassals can declare war on each other only when they have a core or claim on each other.
[*]Daimyo can declare war on Daimyo subject to a different overlord without claim or core.
[*]Overlord doesn't protect Daimyo in wars, but Daimyo join wars.
[*]Non-Japanese tags cannot declare wars on Daimyo.
[*]Some provinces get modifiers representing smaller clans or Kokujins. Those can be removed when a tag has 30 centralisation and has less than 30 autonomy in the province in question.
[*]Kakizaki clan appears in 1356 as a modifier and care in Mutsu province. On modifier being removed, if Kakizaki clan doesn't exist and Osamanpet is empty, then Kakizaki clan appears as a subject of Shogunate/Emperor in Hokkaido.
[*]If Kakizaki clan exists on the map, but Hokkaido is empty, then a random non-extant Japanese tag will appear in Osamanpet.

[*]Minor rebalancing of voting pattern of electors to give more mali to smaller nations, but less boni to larger ones (should prevent OPM emperors, while enabling medium sized emperors)


# Low Countries

[*]Low Countries gameplay improved with tweaks to Burgundian Inheritance, and addition of a new tag with many events and decisions. Dutch War of Independence also changed, with Netherlands being the defender in the war among other changes.
[*]Changes to the Burgundian Inheritance outcome: France chooses between trying to get the inheritance or immediately getting the French provinces. Inheritor now obtains many subjects as 'Rebellious Subjugated Vassals'.
[*]Added Seventeen Provinces (SVP) tag.
[*]Added decision to create SVP, it can be taken by Inheritor or another country who has subjects in the Low Countries. Created as a 'Rebellious Subjugated Vassal', which require subjugations to be annexed.
